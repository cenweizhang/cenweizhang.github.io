I am a senior undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, focusing on pruning strategies for segmentation models (e.g., SAM) of medical imaging data such as polyps. This work serves as my graduation research under the supervision of Asst. Prof. [Suncheng Xiang](https://jeremyxsc.github.io/). I am also working on Generative Modeling (e.g., Flow, Diffusion, AR) and how generative on-manifold flows establish a new explanatory paradigm for Explainable AI, which is guided in detail and pleasantly by Asst. Prof. [Lei You](https://www.leiyou.me/) and Dr. [Lin Zhu](https://zhumumu0216.github.io/).

After SJTU, I will pursue an MSc in Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. With a humble and open attitude, I am delving into AI4Med and flow-based generative modeling. Currently, I am familiarizing myself with various cutting-edge generative models and their mathematical foundations, and I am interested in extending my research into Embodied AI (e.g., Embodied Brain Algorithms).

Besides my work and studies, I also have a passion for citywalking, hiking, and Genshin Impact!
